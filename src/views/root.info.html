      <ul>
        <li>One vote is allowed per ip-address</li>
        <li>We care about your privacy and won't store your ip-address or any other personal identifier in our database. We do however store an anonymous version (hashed) of your ip-address to prevent multiple votes per ip</li>
        <li>We've tried our best to translate most of this site in as many languages as we could. There might still be some silly errors, sorry about that.</li>
