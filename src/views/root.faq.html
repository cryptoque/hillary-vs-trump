          <strong>of the World, in Order to form a more perfect Society, established this website to give everyone a vote in the upcoming U.S. election.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          On November 8th 2016, either Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump will be elected as the 45th president of the Unites States.
          The outcome of this domestic election will have a global effect. People all over the world are watching the U.S. closely during this process.
          We follow all the scandals, debates, polls and wished we’d had a vote.
        </p>

        <p>Now you can!</p>
        <p>
        On this website anyone from any country can cast a vote. Who would Argentine prefer? Or Belgium? Or China? And what about Zimbabwe?
          The results will be accumulated on our <a ui-sref="root.results">visual result map</a>, which is updated in real time - so check back often!
        </p>

        <p>How it works</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One vote is allowed per ip-address</li>
          <li>We care about your privacy and won't store your ip-address or any other personal identifier in our database. We do however store an anonymous version (hashed) of your ip-address to prevent multiple votes per ip</li>
          <li>We've tried our best to translate most of this site in as many languages as we could. There might still be some silly errors, sorry about that.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Is this serious?</p>
        <p>No.</p>
