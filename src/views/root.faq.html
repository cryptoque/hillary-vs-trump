      <dt>What is this website?</dt>

        <p>
          The upcoming presidential election of the United States affects the entire world. Will it be Trump or Hillary? And which candidate do people in other countries prefer?
          We, <a href="http://www.arthurvanthoog.nl">Arthur van 't Hoog</a> (design) and <a href="https://galaxy.fili.nl">Filidor Wiese</a> (development), built this website as a fun
          side-project in our spare time to answer this intriguing question. Please share!

      <dt>How does it work?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          On this site you can vote for either Trump or Hillary until the day of the election, November 8th. To discourage possible abuse one vote is allowed per ip-address and
          no anonymous ip's. The country your vote counts for is determind by the country your ip-address originates from, this can not be changed.

      <dt>What about my privacy?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          We care about your privacy and don't store your ip-address or any other personal identifier in our database. We do store an anonymous (hashed) version of your ip-address to prevent
          multiple votes per ip.

      <dt>Which languages are available</dt>

        <p>
          We've tried our best to translate most of this site in as many languages as we could to allow for a balanced voting result.
          Most of these translations are automated and might contain silly errors. Sorry about that.
